basic concept: front plate holds lcd in place, just locks into backplate with
holes and pins.  Same pin perhaps also sets down into clock stand which angles
the whole thing.  Maybe some sideways holders for actual pi on back plate.

TODO
fixes: Screen can't slide into place rn, remove back wall
holes for posts on back plate shrink too much to fit
create stand, maybe using cooling slots as mount points
"walls" so rpi can't move LR
Make symmetrical
